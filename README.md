# Test auth project

Hello, my name is Egor Tumakov. Welcome to the repository of my test project, which includes an authorization form, registration, and password recovery.

The project consists of a client-side written in Next.js and a server-side written in Nest.js. A mail notification system is in place on the server, which is used for password recovery. You will receive a code to confirm your email.

You can visit the website at [https://eltumakov.com](https://eltumakov.com/).

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project.
